# gitmanager

Gitmanager is a service for building and validating courses, and configuring
other services in the A+ ecosystem. The courses are loaded through git, and then
automatically built inside a configurable container. If the build passes
validation, the course and its exercises are configured on A+ and compatible
grading services.

The application is implemented on Django 5.2 (`gitmanager/settings.py`) and
requires Python 3.10+.

Gitmanager can be run stand alone without the full stack to test any part of
the process in the local system environment. Course and exercise
configuration is in COURSES_PATH directory (defaults to `courses`) once built and published.

Course files are downloaded using git to the BUILD_PATH directory, where the
course is then built. If the build is successfull, the course directory is then
copied to the STORE_PATH directory. That directory is solely for storage, that
version of the course is not available until the course is published. The course
is published by A+ when A+ fetches and updates the course configuration. Once
the course is published, the built course is copied from the STORE_PATH directory
to the COURSES_PATH directory.

## Installing for development

You may run the app with Docker without installing the whole software stack locally.
It is easy to get started with the aplus-manual course:
[apluslms/aplus-manual](https://github.com/apluslms/aplus-manual).
The dockerfile in .github/workflows should contain everything needed to run
the application.

### Ubuntu 20.04

#### 1. Clone the software

General requirements

    sudo apt-get install git libjpeg-dev
    sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev zlib1g-dev

Install software

    git clone https://github.com/apluslms/gitmanager.git

#### 2. Python requirements

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv

Then, create virtual environment with gitmanager requirements.

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install wheel
    pip install -r gitmanager/requirements.txt

#### 3. Running the gitmanager application

Run the Django app locally:

    cd gitmanager
    python manage.py runserver

#### 4. For configuring courses and exercises, see

[courses/README.md](courses/README.md)

## Installing the full stack

### Ubuntu 20.04

#### 0. User account

On a server, one can install gitmanager for a specific gitmanager
user account.

    sudo adduser --system --group \
      --shell /bin/bash --home /srv/gitmanager \
      --gecos "A-plus gitmanager service" \
      gitmanager
    su - gitmanager

**Then follow the "Installing for development" and continue from here.**

#### 1. Web server configuration

##### Create temporary directory for sockets

    echo "d /run/gitmanager 0750 gitmanager www-data - -" | \
      sudo tee /etc/tmpfiles.d/gitmanager.conf > /dev/null
    sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create


Install uwsgi to run WSGI processes. The **gitmanager directory
and user must** be set in the configuration files.

##### uWSGI with systemd (Ubuntu >= 15.04)

    source ~/venv/bin/activate
    pip install uwsgi
    cp ~/gitmanager/doc/etc-uwsgi-gitmanager.ini ~/gitmanager-uwsgi.ini
    sudo cp ~/gitmanager/doc/etc-systemd-system-uwsgi.service /etc/systemd/system/gitmanager-uwsgi.service
    # EDIT ~/gitmanager-uwsgi.ini
    # EDIT /etc/systemd/system/gitmanager-uwsgi.service, set the correct uwsgi path to ExecStart

Operate the workers:

    # as root
    systemctl status gitmanager-uwsgi
    systemctl start gitmanager-uwsgi
    systemctl enable gitmanager-uwsgi  # start on boot
    # Graceful application reload
    touch ~/gitmanager-uwsgi.ini

##### nginx

    apt-get install nginx
    sed -e "s/__HOSTNAME__/$(hostname)/g" \
      ~/gitmanager/doc/etc-nginx-sites-available-gitmanager > \
      /etc/nginx/sites-available/$(hostname).conf
    ln -s ../sites-available/$(hostname).conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/$(hostname).conf
    # Edit /etc/nginx/sites-available/$(hostname).conf if necessary
    # Check nginx config validity
    nginx -t
    systemctl reload nginx

##### apache2

    apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-uwsgi
    # Configure based on doc/etc-apache2-sites-available-gitmanager
    a2enmod headers
